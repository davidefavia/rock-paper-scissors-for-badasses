![Badasses!](src/img/hero.png "Badasses!")

Choose your badass and play against computer!

## Requirements
To develop, serve and build this project you need node.js and `bower` and `gulp` installed globally.

```shell
$ npm install -g bower
$ npm install -g gulp
```

To run tests you also need `karma-cli` installed globally:

```shell
$ npm install -g karma-cli
```

## Installation

Install node modules and bower dependencies:

```shell
$ npm install
$ bower install
```

## Develop while playing

Run task:

```shell
$ gulp serve
```

This task creates a folder named 'build' inside the project, it is removed and created when you run `serve`. If you open your browser at [http://localhost:12345](http://localhost:12345) you can play the game.

If you need to make changes or fix bugs, just modify files inside `src` folder: every change is reflected inside `build` folder and the game is reloaded inside the browser.

### Javascript

Main application file is located at `src/js/app.js`. It describes the **AngularJS** application of the game.

### Styles

**Bootstrap** is the chosen frontend package. For simpliciy you can override **Bootstrap** styles inside `src/less/app.less` file, it is compiled down to CSS at every change and moved to `build/css` folder.

## Build

To build project:

```shell
$ gulp build
```

This task works like `serve` BUT it does not start the webserver and it does not watch `src` files for changes.

You can publish `build` folder content wherever you want!

## Test

To run tests:

```shell
$ npm run test
```

Unit testing is done with **Karma runner** environment and **Jasmine** as framework. Tests run inside **Chrome browser**.

## Todo

- Better responsive layout.
- Use only needed Bootstrap modules (buttons, grid system).
- Javascript concatenation and minification for production.
- Remove useless files for production environment (_e.g._ LESS files).
- Implement "[Rock, paper, scissors, Spock, lizard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors#Additional_weapons)" version.
